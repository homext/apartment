Albie (Lhasapoo) Love My Puppy Boca Raton From lovemypuppy.com
Maltipoos are good dogs for living in either a busy city or in a spacious home in the suburbs and can be happy in most living situations as long as the dog gets to spend a lot of time with the people he loves. The courageous mastiff prefers the comfort of home with its owner over spending time outdoors. Hypoallergenic and and utterly charming, bichons learn quickly and love just about everyone. Many small breeds are great for apartments because they can get a lot of their exercise indoors and don’t need a big space to be able to run around.
