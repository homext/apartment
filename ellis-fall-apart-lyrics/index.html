<p>You may say that i am alive but i'm just breathing and you say that i will be fine but i'm dead when i'm leaving cause fine doesn't mean all the finer things fine doesn't mean living at all whether i eat or i sleep if you're there walking with me watch your world fall apart and these letters on my hand they might fade when i get old they work to remind me and i try to let it go but this rhythm. What i see when i see you itâs not the same like the others do what i feel when iâm next to you and iâm falling through what i promise myself to do is just gone when iâm close to you all the things that i never do but iâm falling through.
